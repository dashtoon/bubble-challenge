# Welcome to the dashtoon Bubble Challenge 

Your goal is to place bubbles in a comic as aesthetically as possible.

This repo provides 60 images.  
10 images with input and output image as sample and a csv with the text in the images.
50 images to test and play with along with the text to be placed.  It is your task to generate bubbles for them.

## Context
The bubble addition on comic images is an additional step which is an additional effort that an illustrator needs to do per image. It is often very obvious in an image where a bubble can even be placed so in order to make comic creation super easy, it is essential to make the bubble additional step trivial or rather automate it.

## Deliverable
Your deliverable are the 50 images with bubbles picked from the CSV. These images should have bubbles of any type placed in the background of the image. Also, add a csv per image with the center of the bubble placed.
Zip them up and email it to givemeajob@dashtoon.com.

## Evaluation
We will evaluate your mean square error yo manual bubble placement done by a comic creator. 

## Hints
- Look at images of your solutions before submitting.
- The dataset is tiny, use caution if using some training.
- Keep the goal in mind, being creative is allowed.
